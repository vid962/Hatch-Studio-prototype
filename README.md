# Hatch-Studio-prototype
It was one of the many prototypes that we have created for the company's needs. Hatch Studio operates in the industrial design sector. The prototype is built on an Arduino chip. It works in a very simple way. After turning the knob and accepting, motor rotates the programmed number of times to get the right amount of powder from the main tank. As you turn the knob, the LED bar shows the selected quantity.
